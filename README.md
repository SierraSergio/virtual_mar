Monitoring marine biodiversity is a challenge in some vulnerable and difficult-to-access 6 habitats, such as underwater caves. Underwater caves are a great focus of biodiversity, 7 concentrating a large number of species in their environment. But, most of the sessile 8 species that live on the rocky walls are very vulnerable, and they are often threatened 9 by different pressures. The use of these spaces as a destination for recreational divers 10 can cause different impacts on the benthic habitat. In this work, we propose a 11 methodology based on video recordings of cave walls and image analysis with deep 12 learning algorithms to estimate the spatial density of structuring species in a study area. 13 We propose a combination of automatic frame overlap detection, estimation of the actual 14 extent of surface cover, and semantic segmentation of the main 10 species of corals and 15 sponges to obtain species density maps. These maps can be the data source for 16 monitoring biodiversity over time. In this paper, we analyzed the performance of three 17 different semantic segmentation algorithms and backbones for this task and found that 18 the Mask-RCNN model with the Xception101 backbone achieves the best accuracy, with 19 an average segmentation accuracy of 82%.
